       "   'comments': \"I stayed at Vicky's place as I was visiting HK for a conference in City University, for 6 days. It is so close that I could go there on foot, and that is why I chose it. However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\\n\\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\\n\\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\\n\\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \\n\\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend.\"},\n",

The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\\n\\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments.

Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\\n\\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\\n\\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas.'},\n",

Silvia’s apartment is located in an upcoming neighbourhood near 2 subway stops which go directly into the city.  Add to this the fact that there is one of the best restaurants in the city nearby (Roberta’s (Website hidden by Airbnb) and you have yourself a winner.  You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the hospitality.  We drove to NYC from Nova Scotia, and we were worried about street parking while we were there but once we arrived it was no problem finding a spot (right across the street from the apt.) and the neighbourhood was very safe.  Just be aware most spots have a 2 hour window twice a week when you have to move for street parking and you’ll be fine.  I’ve seen other comments about the noise in the neighbourhood but either we were too tired to notice or we’re more tolerant because it was never an issue for us.  If you’re looking to do NYC on a budget, Brooklyn is definitely the way to go. We would definitely stay here again.\"},\n",

Then in order to get to the basement apartment you had to go through the garage (which I didn't mind too much) however, it was very crowded with miscellaneous items so you had to be careful coming and going.

It was a good deal and Silvia was very nice and accommodating. Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels!\"},\n",

The private entrance is accessed first into the foyer then through the garage, then down the stairs past the washer and we had no problems with coming in late nights. Partway through our stay some other people came to staying in the other unit she has upstairs and you could definitely hear them but nothing too bad. Shower is small, but again, everything was clean and functional (hot water, wifi, heater, etc.). Great to have the mini-fridge and there was also a toaster oven, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc. and we were able to do a quick load of laundry partway through the stay which was nice (I never heard anyone else doing laundry, but the machine is loud). There is a lock on the bedroom door but not to the main kitchen/bathroom area, though, again, we never saw anyone in the garage or laundry area and I don't expect anyone came into our area. Bed was fairly comfy - firm - and there are now nightstands on both sides of the bed. Lots of great stuff in the area and Silvia provides a binder and map of her favorite bars, restaurants and cultural activities in the area. Several different subway stations within easy walking distance. Would definitely stay again - if you're looking to stay in Brooklyn this is a great, affordable and convenient option.\"},\n",

That area has become too pricey, so we took a chance on Bushwick, hearing it's become fun and eclectic and safer. It was all of that, plus friendly and felt safe.\\n\\nAbsolutely enjoyable area, more than enough coffee shops and restaurants to walk to, and we also walked a lot to nearby Williamsburg, with even more opportunities for great dining. \\n\\nSilvia and her family were wonderful; we enjoyed meeting her smart and charming daughter and her interesting artist husband, who maintains an art studio next-door that you can visit.\\n\\nThis basement apartment is reached through a narrow passageway in a full storage garage, which might be off-putting at first, but don't be fooled: you come down the stairs and into a clean, spacious and minimal apartment.  It is basic, but has everything you need. Extra toiletries, toaster oven, coffee maker, extra comforter, etc. \\nThere's a groovy custom-made bench and iron table to sit at for a quick snack or some sightseeing planning.\\n\\nSilvia provides a three-ring binder with neighborhood menus and house rules. Try El Kucho, just on the next block, *great* Mexican & nice owners. At this time, they have not yet received their liquor license, but about five doors down on the same spot is a great wine store.  \\nArchie's, a nearby bar and pizza spot is a great alternative to the 1-2 hour wait at famous Roberta's pizza.\\n\\nOne or two reviewers here have said that it was warm down there in the summer. The weather was cool during our visit, so we weren't too warm. The temperature was really perfect. There are two small windows in case you feel claustrophobic, but we never did. She has decorated it in a way that feels airy. At any rate, we were out of our room early and back late, enjoying Brooklyn!\\n\\nThe bed and pillows are quite firm, but we slept well. You are in a basement; expect upstairs noise. I am a very light sleeper, so I always bring earplugs; noise wasn't a problem.\\n\\nI don't see how anyone could get a better value in Brooklyn, so close to Brooklyn Heights. I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else again. I see myself coming back here year after year!\\n\"},\n",

Very very useful thank you! You are near the L line (Jefferson Street) and the M line (Central Av) so you have several options to reach Manhattant.

Also, when you get into the apartment, host has a book which gives you suggestions of food toneat in the area. Very helpful. They also have a whole setup of toiletries, irons, hair dryera, toaster oven, etc. For you to use! There's  also a heater which was great because it was very cold.\\n\\nThe not so great: the walls could use cleaning. I only looked at them once and didn't  want to again. Also, the blankets provided have some spots on them so that freaked me out. Finally, when he says small, it's  verrrry small and people over 6'0 might be uncomfortable in the space. \\n\\nOverall, a pretty good experience. \"},\n",

The issue for us was that it was listed and confirmed in messages that the place is 'private', however when my partner was alone in the basement, someone was at the top of the stairs doing the laundry, meaning they could easily come downstairs where there is no lock. We decided to check out early and although I paid for the extra 2 nights, my issue was the lack of courtesy communication from the host. I wrote 2 very honest messages (nice one too) about why we wanted to check out and there was no response and although I didn't expect it, it just felt the host wasn't bothered. Just the lack of courtesy is a result of this review, although I can put up with the fact the place wasn't as described.\"},\n",

If we were staying longer and were looking to stay in and cook or anything, this is too small for that. But since we wanted to explore all day, this is all we needed, and the price is right. Tyrome was very kind and had an awesome art gallery that you walk through to get to the apartment. There were two locking doors so we felt safe. The neighborhood is amazing, right next to Alphaville which is a cool bar and venue. The walk to the Jefferson stop is a bit of a hike for those who arent used to walking like a new yorker, but overall it was close enough to everything. I would stay here again for sure!'},\n",

It's a big city so you need to pay attention, but overall it's a GREAT neighborhood. We also drove there (on a road trip so couldn't skip having a car) and found street parking our entire stay- which was an awesome bonus.\\nThe area isn't huge but is great for NYC. My husband is pretty tall (over 6') but he just watched his head and was fine. The bathroom is small (but really cute for a small space!) and the shower is great.

The apartment had a changing odor from being the laundry room and the basement, meaning that it smelled part time of detergent and part time of moist. Furthermore we didn't have the opportunity to lock the basement door, which we didn't feel good about, due to all of our personal belongings being down there throughout the day. \\n\\nBut in general a decent apartment, where you get what you pay for. Really nice and friendly host though. Tyrome was very helpful, both in person and through text messages. The neighborhood is something of itself. It's a very cool place to be located, if you want to experience Brooklyn, and everything it has to offer.\"},\n",

Though the apartment is in the basement, it wasn't very humid, and Tyrome made everything to make it comfy. We had a nice stay in the very artsy and nice community in Brooklyn. The L train is nearby and Tyrome has a lot of suggestions for activities and places to eat/go out close to the apartment on a cute selfmade (Hidden by Airbnb) map he put into the apartment. The apartment is quite quiet, but you can hear the people above you, which didn't bother us, but if you're sensitive it might disturb your sleep.

The place is small (which we liked) but my husband (6’1”)  kept hitting his head on the vents lol but other than that we loved the space.

L'appartement est très proche d'une station de métro (7 minutes à pied), ce qui est très pratique quand on passe la journée dehors et que l'on souhaite rentrer rapidement le soir. Le quartier est pittoresque avec des petits commerces à proximité. Il est très pratique pour faire ses petites commissions alimentaires. \\nToutefois, il faut garder à l'esprit que l'appartement est en sous-sol et qu'il dispose d'une luminosité faible. A cela s'ajoute un problème d'humidité qui laisse une odeur persistante lorsqu'on rentre le soir. Le manque d'aération est sans doute un facteur explicatif. Il n'est pas possible de cuisiner : l'appartement dispose seulement d'un frigo et d'un évier. \\nMalgré ces derniers éléments nous avons passé un très bon séjour. La communication avec Tyrome a été très facile tout au long du séjour. \"},\n",

Equipments in the kitchen are very limited, dirty, the plates are dusty. There were tasks on our sheets, the pillows smelled badly, no extra-sheets. We stayed for two nights and we were very dissatisfied with our stay, we recommend you to RUN AWAY from this Airbnb for minimum comfort, even though the price seems appealing.

In direkter Umgebung gibt es viele Möglichkeiten etwas Essen oder Trinken zu gehen außerdem findet man in der Wohnung eine Mappe mit Infos der Umgebung. \\nDer Zugang zur Wohnung war anfangs etwas befremdlich, da man durch seine Galerie geht, um dann die Treppe runter in eine Kellerwohnung zu gelangen. Die Wohnung ist sauber und hat alles was man braucht. Da wir immer früh bereits die Wohnung verlassen haben und nur abends zum Schlafen zurück kamen hat es auch nicht gestört, dass kaum Tageslicht zu sehen ist. Im Zugang zum Schlafzimmer verläuft ein Rohr, dass für Leute über 1,70m zu Falle wird. Mein Freund hat sich hier mehrmals den Kopf gestoßen - also immer dran denken, Kopf einziehen ;-)\\nWorauf man sich einstellen muss: man hört die Menschen in der Wohnung herumlaufen und wenn irgendwo Wasser läuft. Uns hat es nicht gestört, aber wenn man empfindlich ist, sollte man das bedenken. \\nDas Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist ok. NY ist teuer und somit hat es den typischen Charme - aus jedem Platz wird etwas gemacht und zum Vermieten genutzt. Ich würde die Wohnung jedoch jederzeit wieder buchen. Sie war sauber und sehr gut gelegen - das wichtigste bei einer Städtereise.'},\n",

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \\r\\n\\r\\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul.\"}]}\n",

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \\r\\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\\r\\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.'}]}\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}]}\n"
